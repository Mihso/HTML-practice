    <div class="mainBody">
    <p>I am a diligent software engineer who values user experience and learning. I am excited about leveraging my engineering skills to provide an intuitive user experience. I have strong proficiency in Full-stack development and collaborating with colleagues.</p>
    <p>I spent much of my undergraduate education understanding how technology affects society and how it incorporates previous media to make the user experience more digestible. As a software engineer, this background informs the applications I build as I strive to create user-accessible tools and software. I excel in pattern recognition, allowing me to quickly pick up and implement new concepts by leveraging previous knowledge. I am also dedicated to executing tasks and features, no matter the constraints. To this end, I thoroughly read the documentation on new techniques and practice to ensure smooth implementation.</p>   
    <p>Collaboration and communication are two of my strong points. I regularly stay past expected hours to check on peers, supporting them through their issues. I will sit down with people and go step-by-step through what actions have already been taken. We communicate and discuss with each other what potential errors could be causing the issues and try out reasonable actions. If I happen to find a solution, I go into detail about what was causing the initial error and explain why a given solution works. Working alongside, helping, and learning from colleagues makes engineering even more meaningful.</p>
